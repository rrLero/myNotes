## Rules on creating custom elements

1. The name of a custom element must contain a dash (-). So `<x-tags>`, `<my-element>`, and `<my-awesome-app>` are all valid names, while `<tabs>` and `<foo_bar>` are not. This requirement is so the HTML parser can distinguish custom elements from regular elements. It also ensures forward compatibility when new tags are added to HTML.

1. You can't register the same tag more than once. Attempting to do so will throw a DOMException. Once you've told the browser about a new tag, that's it. No take backs.

1. Custom elements cannot be self-closing because HTML only allows a few elements to be self-closing. Always write a closing tag (`<app-drawer></app-drawer>`).
