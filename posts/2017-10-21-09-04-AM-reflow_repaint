# Repaint

A repaint occurs when you change the styling of an ele­ment such that it does not effect its layout. For e.g. When you change the background color or outline etc.

**Causes of repaints**
In essence, anything that causes the visual appearance of a DOM node to change causes a repaint of that particular dom node and more than likely all of its children. Some of the causes or repaints are

* Scrolling: When you scroll, the browser has to redraw the pix­els at the place that you scrolled. This is one is not as easily avoidable.
* Changing visibility or colors or background colors.

# Reflow

A reflow primarily occurs when the layout of an element changes. It causes the browser to recompute the dimensions and positioning of the parent and child nodes and sometimes even ances­tors and siblings. Browser implementations differ in the way they optimize for reflows.

The most impor­tant point to be aware of in this dis­cus­sion is

> A reflow is a user-blocking operation. It consumes relatively higher CPU time and will result in a degraded user experience on a mobile device if it happens to often. 

**Causes of reflows**
As a rule of thumb — any­thing that affects the cur­rent ‘flow’ of ele­ments in the page will trig­ger a reflow. Some of the causes of reflows are

* Resizing the window
* Moving your mobile device(tablet/phone) from landscape to por­trait mode and vice versa.
* Changing the font size
* Calculating offsetWidth and offsetHeight
* Changing the height, width, positions
* Changing inline styles
* Using JavaScript methods involving computed styles
* Adding/removing elements from the dom

> In most cases, reflows are followed by a repaint.
