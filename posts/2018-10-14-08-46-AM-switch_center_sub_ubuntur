1- Run in terminal  `gksu gedit /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/profile-sets/default.conf `This is the file where the channel map is, enter you pasword when prompted, and the file will open.

2- You are looking for the code that looks like this-


```
[Mapping analog-surround-51]
device-strings = surround51:%f
channel-map = front-left,front-right,rear-left,rear-right,front-center,lfe
paths-output = analog-output analog-output-speaker analog-output-desktop-speaker analog-output-lfe-on-mono
priority = 8
direction = output
```

3- It may not be exactly the same, but we want to change only the channel-map order
from -
`channel-map = front-left,front-right,rear-left,rear-right,front-center,lfe`
to -
`channel-map = front-left,front-right,rear-left,rear-right,lfe,front-center`

Notice the order on lfe and front-center, lfe is the subwoofer, and front-center is your center speaker, if it displays another configuration, just swap position of lfe and front-center
